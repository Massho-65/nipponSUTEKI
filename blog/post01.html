<!-- ===== Intro Section ===== -->
<section class="post-content intro">
  <p>
    Hello! I'm glad to meet you. Please make yourself at home.
    Imagine sitting in a quiet, sunlit gallery, facing a vast canvas
    that stretches out before you.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today, I'd like to talk about something deeply cherished in the
    Japanese psyche. There's nothing more fitting for the start of
    the new year than the silhouette of Mt. Fuji.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mt. Fuji is more than just a mountain. It has a powerful presence.
    It towers like a guardian, silently watching over the islands.
    Every January, its peak becomes a symbol of hope and inspiration.

  <h2>First Dream</h2>

  <p>
    In Japan, there's a tradition of having "first dreams" on the night
    of January 1st or 2nd. These dreams are believed to predict one's
    fortunes for the coming months.
  </p>

  <p>Some particularly auspicious symbols include:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Mount Fuji (First, Fuji)</li>
    <li>Hawk (Second, Hawk)</li>
    <li>Eggplant (Third, Eggplant)</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    How wonderful! Mount Fuji is number one. As the tallest mountain
    in Japan, it symbolizes ambition, success, and longevity.
    Seeing Mount Fuji's blue slopes and snow-capped peak in a dream
    is said to usher in a wonderful, prosperous year.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's like a gentle, cosmic encouragement.

  <h2>Why Mount Fuji is Loved</h2>

  <p>
    You may wonder why this mountain holds such a special place in our hearts.
    Part of the answer lies in its shape. Notice how its base flares outward.
  </p>

  <p>
    This shape, called a <em>suehiro</em>, symbolizes growth and good fortune
    in Japanese culture — things start small, then grow beautifully.
  </p>

  <p>
    When we gaze upon Mount Fuji, we're not just looking at a volcano.
    Within it lies a quiet prayer for a better tomorrow.

    <p>
      I feel that the beauty of Mt. Fuji isn't about a sudden spark of excitement; 
      it’s more like a quiet sense of peace that gently fills your heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even on the busiest days, just catching a glimpse of its silhouette feels like 
      a gentle hand on your shoulder, reminding you that everything will be okay. 
      I hope you find that same quiet comfort in your own heart this year.
    </p>

  <h2>Mount Fuji in Your Home</h2>

  <p>
    Even if you can't visit Mount Fuji, you can still welcome it into
    your home this New Year. Its image appears on New Year's cards,
    calendars, and everyday objects.
  </p>

  <p>
    When life feels cold and uncertain, Mount Fuji reminds us to face
    challenges with perseverance and dignity.
  </p>

  <p>
    May your days this year be as calm and bright as Mount Fuji in the morning.
    Whether it appears in your dreams or in your heart, may its
    “spreading fortune” bring you joy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through this blog, we introduce moments that feel gentle and timeless.
