Hello, I'm Sari. Nice to meet you! <br><br>
Today, we're talking about Mount Fuji, so I'd like to share something a little different with Kiri. <br><br>
Rather than the kind of information you'd find in a guidebook, I'd like to share the "daily life" of Mount Fuji—the little secrets and moments that make us Japanese smile.

  <h2>"Find Mt. Fuji" Game</h2>
Did you know that in Tokyo, many people choose their apartment based on whether they can see the tiny triangle of Mt. Fuji from their balcony?<br>
Even a tiny blue dot among the skyscrapers can excite us!<br><br>
 "Mt. Fuji is beautiful today!" some people post photos on social media as if it were a beloved neighbor. <br>
On a clear winter morning, seeing white clouds peeking out from a train window or office building feels like a good omen, a sign that the day will be wonderful.<br>
It's like a double rainbow!

        <h2>Why Mt. Fuji is Painted in Public Baths</h2>
        <p>If you visit a traditional Japanese public bath, known as a <strong>"Sento,"</strong> you will likely see a giant, hand-painted mural of Mt. Fuji on the wall behind the main bathtub.</p>
        <p>In the past, most people didn't have private bathrooms at home. Going to a Sento was a special treat. Soaking in the warm water while gazing at a massive painting of Mt. Fuji made bathers feel as though they were at a <span class="highlight">luxury resort</span>. It symbolized ultimate relaxation and "soul refreshment." Even while washing your back, having Mt. Fuji there brings a sense of peace.</p>

        <h2>Mt. Fuji in Your Pocket</h2>
        <p>Mount Fuji isn't just a distant landmark; we carry it with us every day. If you have a <strong>1,000 yen bill</strong>, take it out and look at the back. There it is!</p>
        <p>No matter where we go in the country, having Mt. Fuji in our wallets serves as a constant reminder of home and the heart of Japan.</p>

      <h2>Edible Mt. Fuji: A Must-Try for Visitors</h2>
        <p>While tourists love Mt. Fuji for its perfect symmetry, we always tell our friends: <em>"Don't just look at it—try the sweets!"</em> We love transforming our favorite mountain into delicious treats, especially during the New Year season.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mt. Fuji Chocolates:</strong> Featuring strawberry "lava" or white chocolate "snow."</li>
            <li><strong>Mt. Fuji Curry:</strong> An eye-catching dish made with blue rice shaped like the mountain.</li>
            <li><strong>Mt. Fuji Craft Beer:</strong> Brewed using fresh spring water from the base of the mountain.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Whether it’s edible, wearable, or giftable, these creations are our way of saying: <strong>"We love Mount Fuji!"</strong></p>
