  <h1>A Magical Walk Through Red Gates</h1>
  <p class="post-author">by Sari</p>

<section class="post-content intro">
  <p>Hi, it’s Sari.</p>

  <p>
    Guess what? I finally visited <strong>Fushimi Inari Taisha</strong> in Kyoto!  
    I’ve always wanted to go, but I was actually a little nervous.
  </p>

  <p>
    With all those torii gates lined up, it feels like you’re stepping into another world.  
    Honestly, it’s a bit scary at first (lol).
  </p>

  <p>
    But when I finally walked through them, I totally understood why people from overseas say it feels so magical.
  </p>

  <h2>It’s Like a Bright Red Tunnel</h2>

  <p>
    First of all, those thousands of torii gates are even more vibrant than photos.  
    They seem to go on forever.
  </p>

  <p>
    A friend from overseas told me, “It feels like stepping into a movie world,” and I totally agree.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once you step inside, the outside noise disappears and it suddenly becomes quiet.  
    For a moment, I even thought, “Wait… can I get back?” (lol)
  </p>

  <p>
    But then sunlight filters through the gaps between the gates, and it sparkles beautifully.
    The mysterious atmosphere makes you forget your fear and just want to keep walking.

  <h2>Inari Shrine: The Guardian of Food</h2>

  <p>
    You know those fox statues everywhere at Fushimi Inari?
    They have sharp eyes and a slightly intimidating look, so when I meet their gaze, I feel like saying, “Oh, sorry!” (lol)
  </p>

  <p>
    But foxes are actually messengers of the gods, and Inari is the deity of harvest and food.
    Thinking about it like that, I suddenly felt a kind of connection.
  </p>

  <p>
    Maybe the reason we can enjoy delicious rice and see full supermarket shelves is because these foxes are watching over us.
    I found myself bowing and saying, “Thank you, as always!”
  </p>

    <p>
      I don’t try to overthink it when I come here.
    </p>
    <p>
      I just walk, look up, and let the quiet fill me. That’s enough.

  <h2>The Stairs Are a Little Adventure</h2>

  <p>
    To be honest, climbing to the top is quite challenging.
    At one point, I almost gave up thinking, “How far does this go?”
  </p>

  <p>
    But then, a foreign tourist greeted me with a smile and a friendly “Hi!”
    and that little moment gave me a boost.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even if I didn’t make it all the way to the top, the pond along the way—<strong>Shinike</strong>—felt incredibly mystical.
    It was the perfect balance of thrill and calm for someone like me.
  </p>

<section class="post-content">
  <h2>Next Time: Kitsune Udon!</h2>

  <p>
    Next time, I want to eat <strong>Kitsune Udon</strong> before I leave.
    It has fried tofu, which is the fox’s favorite, so I’m sure it will bring me good luck.
  </p>

  <p>
    Why don’t you come with me next time?
    It’s a little scary alone, but I feel like we could reach the top together!
