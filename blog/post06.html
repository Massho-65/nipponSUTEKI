  <h1>The Crimson Gate of Asakusa</h1>

<!-- ===== Intro ===== -->
<section class="post-content intro">
  <p>
    If you’ve ever glimpsed Tokyo through photographs,  
    you may already know this gate.
  </p>

  <p>
    A deep crimson structure,  
    a giant red lantern gently swaying beneath it,  
    and two silent guardians watching over the street.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is <strong>Kaminarimon</strong> —  
    the front gate of Sensoji Temple,  
    and the beginning of Asakusa’s story.
  </p>

  <p>
    At first glance, it feels bold and energetic.  
    But if you pause for a moment,  
    you may sense something quieter beneath the color —  
    a gate that has patiently stood between the everyday world  
    and a space of prayer for centuries.
  </p>

<!-- ===== Guardians Section ===== -->
<section class="post-content">
  <h2>Guardians of Wind and Thunder</h2>

  <p>
    Kaminarimon’s official name is <strong>Fuuraijinmon</strong>,  
    the Gate of Wind and Thunder.
  </p>

  <p>
    As you stand before it,  
    look carefully to both sides.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Fuujin</strong>, the Wind God, rests on the right.  
      He carries a great bag of wind over his shoulder,  
      reminding us of nature’s invisible power.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Raijin</strong>, the Thunder God, stands on the left,  
      surrounded by drums that echo storms from the sky.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Though often feared in folklore,  
    here they serve as protectors —  
    guarding the temple from disaster,  
    and watching over the lives of the people beyond the gate.
  </p>

  <p>
    Strength, in Japan, is not always gentle —  
    but it is always purposeful.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ===== Lantern Section ===== -->
<section class="post-content">
  <h2>The Giant Lantern at the Center</h2>

  <p>
    Hanging at the heart of the gate  
    is the enormous red lantern.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nearly four meters tall and weighing around 700 kilograms,  
    it quietly commands attention without asking for it.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you step closer and look beneath it,  
    you’ll find something unexpected —  
    an intricately carved <strong>wooden dragon</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In Japanese belief, the dragon is a guardian of water.  
    In a city shaped by fire and rebirth,  
    this dragon carries a silent wish: protection through rain.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <strong>A Small Detail Worth Noticing</strong><br>
    The lantern bears the name of Matsushita Electric (now Panasonic).  
    It was donated in 1960 by Konosuke Matsushita  
    as an offering of gratitude after recovering from illness.  
    Even large gates, it seems, are built from personal prayers.
  </blockquote>
</section>

<!-- ===== Nakamise Section ===== -->
<section class="post-content">
  <h2>Beyond the Gate: Nakamise Street</h2>

  <p>
    Passing through Kaminarimon does not bring you directly to the temple.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instead, you enter <strong>Nakamise Street</strong> —  
    a 250-meter path lined with small shops,  
    many of which have welcomed visitors for generations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tradition and daily life walk side by side here.  
    Sweets, crafts, laughter, and footsteps  
    blend into a rhythm that feels uniquely Asakusa.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is not hurried.  
    It invites you to walk slowly.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ===== Best Time Section ===== -->
<section class="post-content">
  <h2>When to Visit</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Early Morning</strong><br>
      Before the crowds arrive, the gate feels calm and reflective.  
      You may notice painted shutters and the quiet breath of the street.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Night</strong><br>
      Softly illuminated after sunset,  
      the gate seems to step back in time,  
      holding the day’s memories in its shadows.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Sanja Matsuri (May)</strong><br>
      During one of Tokyo’s liveliest festivals,  
      the lantern is folded away to allow sacred mikoshi to pass.  
      Even the gate knows when to make space.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ===== Etiquette ===== -->
<section class="post-content">
  <h2>A Gentle Note on Etiquette</h2>

  <p>
    As you pass beneath Kaminarimon,  
    many people bow lightly toward the temple ahead.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is not a rule —  
    just a small gesture of respect.
  </p>

  <p>
    When walking, keep to the sides of the path.  
    The center is traditionally left open,  
    a quiet passage reserved for the gods.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ===== Kiri Comment ===== -->
<aside class="character-comment kiri">
  <img src="../image/characters/kiri.png" alt="Kiri" class="character-icon">
  <div>
    <p class="character-name">Kiri</p>
    <p>
      Kaminarimon may appear bold at first glance,  
      but its true strength lies in what it protects —  
      a quiet space where people pause, bow,  
      and step into something older than themselves.
    </p>
  </div>
</aside>

<!-- ===== Closing ===== -->
<section class="post-content">
  <p>
    Kaminarimon is often called the face of Asakusa.
  </p>

  <p>
    But perhaps it is more than that.  
    It is a reminder that even in a busy city,  
    there are places designed to help us slow down —  
    to step across a threshold,  
    and leave the noise behind, if only for a moment.
