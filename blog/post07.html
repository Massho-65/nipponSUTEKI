  <h1>The Floating Sanctuary: Why Itsukushima Shrine Rises Above the Sea</h1>
  <p class="post-author">by Kiri</p>
</header>


<!-- ===== Intro ===== -->
<section class="post-content intro">
  <p>
    If you’ve ever scrolled through photos of Japan,  
    you’ve probably seen it.
  </p>

  <p>
    A vermilion torii gate  
    standing quietly in the middle of the sea.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is <strong>Itsukushima Shrine</strong>,  
    on the sacred island of Miyajima —  
    one of Japan’s most unforgettable views.
  </p>

  <p>
    But why build a wooden shrine  
    where the tides rise and fall every day?
  </p>

  <p>
    To understand that,  
    we have to look beyond architecture  
    and step into the ancient soul of Japan.

<section class="post-content">
  <h2>The Island Itself is a God</h2>

  <p>
    In ancient Japanese <strong>Shinto</strong>,  
    nature isn’t just home to spirits —  
    it <em>is</em> the spirit.
  </p>

  <p>
    Miyajima Island was believed to be a <strong>Goshintai</strong>,  
    the physical body of a deity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stepping directly onto the land  
    once felt like stepping onto something sacred.
  </p>

  <p>
    So instead of building on the island,  
    people chose to build over the water.
  </p>

  <p>
    Worshippers arrived by boat,  
    passing through the torii  
    as if crossing into another world.
  </p>
</section>


<!-- ===== Section 2 ===== -->
<section class="post-content">
  <h2>A Theater of Tides</h2>

  <p>
    Itsukushima is never the same twice.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>High Tide</strong><br>
      The shrine floats gently on the waves,  
      reflecting red and blue like a dream.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Low Tide</strong><br>
      The sea retreats,  
      revealing a hidden path where visitors can walk to the gate.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This change wasn’t accidental.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was designed as a stage —  
    a reminder that everything in nature moves,  
    shifts, and flows.
  </p>

<!-- ===== Section 3 ===== -->
<section class="post-content">
  <h2>The Vision of Taira no Kiyomori</h2>

  <p>
    The shrine’s graceful form today  
    owes much to a 12th-century leader,  
    <strong>Taira no Kiyomori</strong>.<br>
    (He wasn’t just a warrior. He was also a statesman and a patron of art — a samurai who built beautiful shrines to show both faith and power.)
  </p>

  <p>
    He used the elegant <strong>Shinden-zukuri</strong> style,  
    usually reserved for aristocratic palaces,  
    and created a sanctuary that felt like a floating residence for the gods.
  </p>

  <p>
    For him, it was both devotion  
    and a statement of power.
  </p>

  <p>
    The brilliant vermilion color,  
    meant to ward off evil,  
    was designed to impress both heaven and earth.

      I love how this place doesn’t fight the ocean.  
      It simply moves with it.  
      Maybe that’s why it feels so calm —  
      like people and nature finally agreed to coexist.

<!-- ===== Closing ===== -->
<section class="post-content">
  <p>
    Itsukushima Shrine isn’t just a beautiful photo spot.
  </p>

  <p>
    It’s a quiet lesson in harmony.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instead of conquering nature,  
    it listens to it.
  </p>

  <p>
    And when you stand before the floating gate,  
    you’re witnessing a thousand years  
    of conversation between humanity and the sea.
